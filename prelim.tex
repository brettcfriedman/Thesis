\acknowledgments {This thesis culminates several years of hard work, and could not have been completed without the help of many individuals to whom I owe much thanks. First, I must thank my
advisor, Professor Troy Carter, for giving me enough guidance throughout the process to help me constantly progress, and more importantly, for allowing me great freedom in following whatever
courses of research I deemed most interesting. I could not have asked for a more knowledgeable, understanding, and helpful advisor and friend. Also at this level, I thank Dr. Maxim Umansky
from LLNL, who has acted as a mentor and a second advisor throughout my time at UCLA. While under no obligation to help, he has continuously given advice, support, knowledge, direct help,
and friendship throughout the process. I would not have made nearly as much progress without him, and I greatly appreciate his mentorship while I briefly worked at Livermore. Furthermore,
Dr. Pavel Popovich helped me start on this research, being increadibly patient while I tried to learn everything from Linux commands to plasma theory, asking him nearly every day a number
of basic questions that he happily answered. He helped ease much of the frustration associated with starting a new field of research, and I owe him so much thanks.

I would also like to thank UCLA Professor George Morales for teaching me the basics of plasma physics. His methods instilled in me an appreciation for mathematical rigor, careful analysis, and the
importance of in depth reading of papers. He has also made himself available to me for research questions and explanations of difficult theoretical topics. Additionally, I acknowledge and thank
York Professor Ben Dudson for writing the fantastic BOUT++ code, which has made my work so much easier. I also thank him for quickly and effectively answering all of my questions regarding the code,
and for fixing some bugs that could have set me back a long time. Furthermore, LLNL Dr. Ilon Joseph deserves thanks for carefully reading my work, discussing theory with me, teaching me a lot,
and most importantly for suggesting a change to one of my equations that has greatly improved my work. Also, I thank LLNL Dr. Xueqiao Xu for our many helpful discussions, for helping create the
BOUT++ community and bringing me into it, and for his help in advancing my career goals. Finally, Dr. David Schaffner has always provided me with all of the experimental data I could ever ask for and
more, never making me wait.

I also must acknowledge the great friends I have made during my time at UCLA. Without them, I probably would have made much more progress and finished faster, but then again, I may not have made it
out alive without them. Brandon, Scott, Dan, other Scott -- their friendship has been invaluable. David, Tom, Derek, Erik, Gio, Seth, Mike, Yuhou, Danny -- my plasma buddies, conference friends, people
who let me ramble on about theory; I thank you all. I thank Eric and Mikhail for taking me in during my time at LLNL, making that experience truly enjoyable. I thank so many others at UCLA.
And, of course, I thank my absolutely wonderful girlfriend, Alli for making my life so much better.

And last but not least, I thank my entire family, all of whom have always supported me, loved me, encouraged me, and raised me to be who I am today. I could not ask for better parents or a better
sister. And I especially acknowledge my grandparents, who have given me all of the encouragement, love, and sustenance they could over the past several years.}
